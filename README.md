# Project Description

This repository addresses a common scenario in the field of Machine Learning Engineering, particularly within a production environment. It involves building a solution for online reranking of a given list of items, applicable to a wide range of contexts such as goods in e-commerce, restaurants in food delivery services, audio tracks or movies in online streaming, etc. 

A central aspect of the task involves working with an anonymized dataset of user sessions. The solution includes training a ranking model for the optimal presentation of content. The model's role is to evaluate and rearrange items within a user session, thereby prioritizing the "best" or most appropriate items for the user.

## Project Objectives:

1. **Development of a Training Pipeline:** The primary goal is to create a class or method capable of processing two distinct datasets. One dataset includes variable session data, while the other contains static item attributes. The pipeline should effectively train the model, leading to the production of a model artifact and relevant metrics.

2. **Establishment of an Inference Service:** The project requires the creation of a REST service. This service should be capable of accepting a list of item IDs and corresponding features from a request. If necessary, it should enrich these features using a cache, utilize the features and a model artifact to make predictions, and return a list of item IDs with associated scores.

3. **Docker Integration:** The inference service and cache should be incorporated into Docker containers and orchestrated appropriately.

4. **Selection of Model and Frameworks:** Given the real-time scoring requirements of the model, it is crucial to select appropriate models and frameworks.

5. **Adherence to Coding Standards:** The code should follow best practices, including correct formatting, the usage of type hints, and inclusion of informative comments. Python is the recommended language for this project.

6. **Proposition of Future Enhancements:** Given the limited development timeline, it may not be feasible to address all intricate details. Therefore, potential enhancements have been identified and registered as issues within the repository.

## Additional Details:

The provided dataset is designed to mirror real-world situations, complete with their complexities. Some significant column details include:

- `has_seen_item_in_this_session`: If false, the user has not seen this item during the session.
- `is_new_user`: Indicates whether the user is new to the platform.
- `is_from_order_again`: Denotes whether the user has previously ordered this item.
- `is_recommended`: Represents an unspecified personalized recommendation available at prediction time.

The approach to this project emphasizes the clarity and quality of the code, comprehension of basic principles, and the rationale behind decisions made. The design doesn't need to be excessively detailed, but it showcase a sound understanding of the project's requirements.
